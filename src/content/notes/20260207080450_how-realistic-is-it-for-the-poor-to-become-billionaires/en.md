Imagine you're a child born into a poor family. Every day, you hear motivational stories about how someone managed to escape poverty and become wealthy. "If they can do it, why can't you?"—that's what we often hear.

But how realistic is the dream of becoming a millionaire (having wealth ≥ USD 1 million—globally referred to as multi-millionaire) for someone starting from zero? Let's break it down with data and facts, without misleading motivational fluff.

## 1. The Bitter Truth: Only 1-2% of the World's Population Are Millionaires

Let's start with the most basic fact. According to the [UBS report on global wealth](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-added-over-1000-new-millionaires-day-last-year-ubs-report-says-2025-06-18/), only about **1-2%** of adults worldwide have wealth exceeding USD 1 million (approximately Rp16,855,500,000 at the time this note was written). This means that out of every 100 adults, only 1-2 people successfully achieve "millionaire" status.

This isn't just a statistical number. It shows that becoming a millionaire is **not a common outcome** for the majority of the world's population. If you think that "everyone can get rich if they just work hard," this data shows that reality is far more complex than that.

Think of it this way: if becoming a millionaire were something easily achievable, the numbers would be much higher. But the reality is that 98-99% of the world's population don't reach that level.

## 2. Extreme Wealth Concentration: The Top 1% Captures Most of the Pie

Now, let's look at how global wealth is distributed. According to the [World Inequality Report 2022](https://wir2022.wid.world/www-site/uploads/2022/01/Summary_WorldInequalityReport2022_English.pdf), over the past few decades, the **top 1%** of the world's population has captured a very large share of global wealth growth.

What does this mean? When the world economy grows and generates new wealth, most of that growth doesn't flow to the other 99% of the population. Instead, that new wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of a few who are already rich.

This creates a cycle that's hard to break: people who already have capital get higher returns from their investments. Returns from capital (stocks, real estate, large-scale businesses) are usually much greater than returns from wage labor. As a result, the gap between the rich and the poor keeps widening.

Think of it this way: someone who has USD 1 million and invests it with a 10% annual return will earn USD 100,000 per year (approximately Rp1,685,550,000) without having to work. Meanwhile, someone who only has monthly wages must work hard all year to earn the same amount—or even less.

## 3. Low Social Mobility: Very Small Chance of Rising from Bottom to Top

One important concept in understanding inequality is **intergenerational mobility**—how likely a child from a poor family is to rise to a higher economic class compared to their parents.

[The World Bank study on Intergenerational Mobility](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/817351624329601595/pdf/Intergenerational-Mobility-around-the-World.pdf) shows that in many countries, especially low and middle-income countries, this social mobility is very low. In the United States, for example, only about **4%** of children from families in the bottom quintile (the poorest 20%) eventually succeed in reaching the top quintile (the richest 20%).

This means that out of 100 children born into poor families, only 4 people successfully reach the top economic class. The rest? They tend to remain in the same economic class as their parents.

Why does this happen? Because initial factors are very determining:

- **Education**: Children from wealthy families have access to high-quality education, while poor children often get stuck in low-quality schools.
- **Connections**: Social networks and family connections are crucial for getting good job or business opportunities. The rich have access to broader and more influential networks.
- **Financial capital**: Wealthy families can provide initial capital to start a business or investment, while poor families don't have this "safety net."

## 4. Indonesia Context: Millionaires Are Only 0.06-0.08% of the Population

Now, let's look at the situation in Indonesia specifically. According to the [UBS 2023 report](https://www.goodnewsfromindonesia.id/short/orang-kaya-di-indonesia-diproyeksikan-akan-tumbuh-hingga-235-1-ribu-orang-pada-2028), the number of Indonesians with wealth exceeding USD 1 million is approximately **178,600 people**. This is projected to rise to around 235,100 people by 2028.

Compared to Indonesia's total population of approximately 281 million people ([according to Macrotrends data](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/idn/indonesia/population)), this means only about **0.06-0.08%** of the population achieve millionaire status. Or if we calculate based on the adult population (≥15 years old) of around 216 million, the figure becomes about **0.08%**.

This means that out of every 1,000 adults in Indonesia, less than 1 person successfully becomes a millionaire. The probability is very small.

But wait, you might think: "But Indonesia's population keeps growing, so the number of millionaires will also increase, right?" True, but population growth also continues. So the proportion remains small.

## 5. Structural Causes: Not Just "Moral Failure"

Often, when we discuss poverty and inequality, there's a narrative that blames individuals: "They're poor because they're lazy," or "If you want to work hard, you can definitely get rich." But in reality, the problem is far more complex and structural.

### Return from Capital vs Return from Labor

As I mentioned earlier, returns from capital are usually much greater than returns from wage labor. This isn't just theory—it's an economic fact that has been empirically proven.

Someone who has USD 100,000 in capital and invests it in the stock market with an average return of 10% per year will earn USD 10,000 per year without having to work. Meanwhile, someone who works with a salary of USD 10,000 per year must work full-time to earn the same amount.

The problem? The poor don't have capital to invest. They only have time and energy to sell as wages. And these wages can never beat returns from capital in the long run.

### Unequal Access

Another problem is unequal access to various resources:

- **Productive credit**: Banks prefer to lend to people who already have collateral or a good track record. The poor who don't have collateral find it difficult to get loans to start a business.
- **Networks and connections**: Many business and job opportunities come from social networks. The rich have access to broader and more influential networks.
- **Markets**: Access to larger markets often requires significant initial capital. The poor don't have this capital.
- **Quality education**: High-quality education is often expensive. Children from poor families find it difficult to access it.

### Policies That Widen the Gap

Another factor that widens inequality is unfair fiscal policies and regulations. The [World Inequality Report 2022](https://wir2022.wid.world/www-site/uploads/2022/01/Summary_WorldInequalityReport2022_English.pdf) confirms that the following factors widen the inequality gap:

- **Tax planning**: The rich have access to tax consultants who can help them reduce their tax burden legally (or even illegally).
- **Exclusive investment access**: Many profitable investment instruments are only available to investors with large capital (private equity, hedge funds, etc.).
- **Biased regulations**: Many regulations indirectly favor capital owners over workers.

## 6. Reality Without Sugar Coating: Possible, But Very Rare

After looking at all this data and facts, what's the conclusion?

**Can the poor become rich?** Yes, they can. There are real cases where someone starting from a poor family successfully became very rich. But this **happens very rarely**.

Usually, people who successfully "leap far" from poor to very rich involve a combination of several factors:

1. **Exceptional talent**: Abilities or skills that are very rare and highly valuable.
2. **High risk**: Willingness to take big risks (like starting a business) that could end in great success or total failure.
3. **Access to capital or networks**: Whether from family, friends, or investors who believe and are willing to provide initial capital.
4. **Long time**: The process of wealth accumulation usually takes decades, not overnight.
5. **Luck**: There's an element of luck that can't be planned—like perfect timing, a rising market, or unexpected opportunities.

**Rational expectations**: For the majority of the poor, the probability of reaching USD 1 million in liquid assets in their lifetime is **very small**—unless there are significant structural changes. These changes could include:

- Better access to capital, education, and networks
- Stronger redistributive policies (such as fairer progressive taxation, or more effective assistance programs)
- Systemic changes that reduce structural inequality

## Conclusion: A Reality That Must Be Accepted

Becoming rich from being poor is possible, but very rare. Data shows that only a tiny fraction of the population successfully achieve millionaire status, and most of them already started from a better position than we think.

This doesn't mean we should give up or not try. But it's important to have realistic expectations. If you start from a poor family and successfully improve your economic condition to the middle class, that's already an extraordinary achievement—even if you haven't become a millionaire.

More importantly, it's crucial to understand that poverty isn't just an "individual problem" that can be solved by "hard work" alone. This is a structural problem that requires structural solutions as well.

So, if you're someone struggling to improve your economic condition, don't be too hard on yourself if you haven't become a millionaire. What matters is to keep trying and understand that the system also needs to change to provide fairer opportunities for everyone.

And if you're someone already in a better position, maybe it's time to question: is the existing system fair? Have we done enough to provide equal opportunities for everyone?

Because ultimately, a fair society isn't one where everyone becomes a millionaire—but one where everyone has equal opportunities to reach their best potential, regardless of their economic background.
