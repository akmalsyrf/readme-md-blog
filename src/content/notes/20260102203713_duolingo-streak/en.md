### Prologue: The Green Gatekeeper

The sun has just set, leaving a streak of orange that is slowly being swallowed by the darkness. While others unwind with a cup of coffee or endless scrolling on social media, I sit frozen in the corner of my room. My skin crawls—not because of a ghost, but because of a notification that just appeared on my phone screen.

_“Don't let your streak go cold! Duo is waiting.”_

The green owl. With those wide, round eyes and a smile that seems friendly but hides a veiled "threat" for those who are negligent. It has been four hundred and twelve days since I decided to surrender a small portion of my life to the ambition of learning two polar opposite languages: English and Japanese.

### Chapter 1: The Blood Pact

It all began at the end of 2024. At that time, I had just emerged from an exhausting battlefield: an **intensive IELTS preparation program at Golden English**. My brain was still saturated with _Writing Task 2_ structures and rapid _skimming_ techniques. However, my motivation was more than just a certificate on paper. I had a bigger dream: **to break into the global job market as a Software Engineer.**

I craved the freedom of working remotely, building code for companies on the other side of the world from behind my desk in my room. Several interview calls had come my way, raising my hopes, but unfortunately, none had reached the finish line. Those failures taught me a bitter lesson: technical skills aren't enough if your tongue is still tied when explaining system architecture in English.

I didn't want my investment at [Golden English](https://golden-course.com/ielts-preparation-program/) to simply evaporate. I had to _try hard_ to maintain my skills. I wanted to ensure that when that golden opportunity came again, my win rate would be at its peak. So, I made a deal with the green bird to act as a goalkeeper, ensuring my English wouldn't get rusty.

However, in the midst of that career ambition, my adventurous soul whispered. In May 2025, I decided to challenge myself with **Japanese**. My reason wasn't just to watch anime without subtitles; I saw a **massive remote IT career opportunity in the Land of the Rising Sun.** Japan is aggressively pursuing digital transformation, and I wanted to be at the forefront when the door of opportunity swung open.

I started from absolute zero. The first two months were a ritual of both torture and meditation: a total focus on _Hiragana_ and _Katakana_. Every morning and night, I drew those foreign strokes on my phone screen until my fingers memorized them by heart. Once those two basic scripts were rooted, the real giant appeared on the horizon: **Kanji.**

### Chapter 2: The Kanji Labyrinth and the Preposition Trap

As I hit the 100-day mark, the battlefield began to shift. Japanese was no longer as sweet as _sushi_. It turned into a dark and misleading forest of _Kanji_. This was where I realized that memorizing shapes wasn't enough. I had to face the harsh reality that a single character could have a split personality—or even five.

Take this simple character as an example: **日**.

Visually, it’s just a box with a line in the middle, representing the sun or a day. Sounds easy, right? But under Duo's "terror," this character transforms into a confusing little monster.

- When standing alone, it is read as **Hi** (Sun).
- When used to say Sunday, it changes to **Nichi** (日曜日—notice that the first and last characters are the same).
- If I talk about Japan (The Land of the Rising Sun), it suddenly becomes **Ni** (日本).
- To mention the second day of the month, it disguises itself as **Ka** (二日).
- And let’s not forget the reading **Bi**, as in _Tan-jou-bi_ (Birthday).

Why must one little box carry so much weight? Why must the sentence structure be reversed like a broken mirror, forcing my brain—which is so used to Subject-Verb-Object—to think in an entirely new pattern?

On the other hand, English—despite my familiarity with it since **Golden English**—still demanded uncompromising precision. _Present Perfect_ and _Past Continuous_ remained ghosts of the past, demanding clarity. "Have I done it?" or "Was I doing it at that time?". The difference in a single verb tense could change the entire professional meaning of a job application email.

This is where the "terror" truly began. There were nights when I returned home with my brain smoking after a long day of work and university lectures. I just wanted to sleep. Yet, the image of that green bird haunted me through phone notifications. It didn't care for excuses about how tired I was. It only needed five minutes of my time.

If I didn't comply, that sacred number in the top right corner—the symbol of the discipline I had built for months—would return to zero. And in the world of a _streaker_, returning to zero is a small death. A failure I was unwilling to accept in the midst of my struggle for an uncertain remote career.

### Chapter 3: The Art of Survival Under Terror

Maintaining a streak for 400+ days is no longer about luck; it is a war strategy. There were days when my motivation hit rock bottom, or when the busyness of work and university consumed all my time. That’s when I implemented a multi-layered defense system to keep that number on my screen from resetting.

**First, the "Narrow Gap" Strategy.** I learned that Duolingo doesn't need a scheduled time. I do it at home, at the running track, or even in the intervals while code is being generated by AI. No place is too sacred or too busy for one short practice session.

**Second, Defining Boundaries (Focus Limitation).** Learning two languages simultaneously is a recipe for instant failure if you don't have priorities. Since my main goal is to maintain English fluency for job interviews, I treat those sessions as "maintenance."

However, for Japanese, I am self-aware. I don't force myself to be immediately fluent in speaking or to understand complex grammar. Currently, I apply a strict limitation: **focus only on vocabulary enrichment and Kanji memorization.** For me, Kanji is the main gate. I allow myself to drown in those strokes, building a strong visual foundation before truly diving into the storm of grammar later on.

**Third, the "Just Keep Moving" Mentality.** There are nights when I am sick or utterly exhausted. In those moments, I don’t force a perfect score. I just open one light review session—even if it’s just repeating basic words. The important thing is to keep the momentum. As the saying goes, _"It doesn't matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop."_

### Chapter 4: Reflections at 400

Now, at over 400 days, I look back. What have I gained from the "terror" of this green bird?

No, I am still far from being as fluent as a local in New York or Tokyo. But something has changed within me. I’ve learned that language is about persistence, not just intelligence. I’ve learned that a small mistake in _grammar_ isn't the end of the world, as long as I’m willing to fix it tomorrow.

English now feels more like an old friend getting closer. Japanese, though it still often presents me with complex puzzles, is starting to reveal its beauty. I’m beginning to catch the emotion in a sentence without needing to translate it word-for-word in my head.

### Epilogue: Keep Running

Duo is still there, inside my phone, waiting patiently. He might be a metaphor for harsh discipline, or perhaps just a very well-designed algorithm. But to me, he is a silent witness to my 400-day transformation.

Every time I see that streak number increase, I don’t just see my linguistic progress. I see 400 failures to give up. I see 400 tiny victories over laziness.

So, for those of you out there struggling, do not fear the green bird. Let him terrorize you, let him chase you, because in the end, behind that pressure, you will find a stronger version of yourself—one word at a time.

_Thank you, ありがとうございます, Duo._
